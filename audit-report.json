    "reasoning": "The metadata contains generic placeholder text 'Create Next App' and 'Generated by create next app' which are default boilerplate values from Next.js scaffolding. These do not represent the actual application name or purpose and should be replaced with production-ready branding.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Replace with actual application branding: Update title to reflect the real application name (e.g., '4Flow - AI Workflow Platform') and description to accurately describe the application's purpose. Key points: Remove all create-next-app references, use proper SEO-friendly metadata that aligns with business requirements."

    "fakeContentType": "mock",
    "reasoning": "This endpoint implements a completely fake weather data tool that generates random temperature values and hardcoded responses ('Sunny', '12%' humidity, '35 km/h' wind speed). The execute function includes a 1.5-second delay and returns fabricated data without any real API integration, making it unsuitable for production use.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Integrate with a production weather API service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or similar) using AISDKV5 tool capabilities. Replace mock data generation with actual API calls, implement proper error handling, and ensure data schema matches the selected weather service. Key points: Remove setTimeout delay, replace Math.random() temperature generation with real API responses, implement proper API key management."

    "fakeContentType": "demo",
    "reasoning": "The API route is named 'weather' but is actually used as the main chat endpoint in page.tsx line 86. This naming inconsistency suggests this is demo code that was adapted from a weather example without proper refactoring for production use.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Rename the route to '/api/chat/route.ts' to accurately reflect its purpose, or create a separate proper chat endpoint. Update the transport reference in app/page.tsx line 86 to use the correct endpoint path. Key points: Ensure endpoint naming matches functionality, remove weather-specific demo elements if not needed."

    "fakeContentType": "placeholder",
    "reasoning": "The system prompt 'You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks' is a generic placeholder that provides no specific guidance or context for the AI's behavior in this particular application's domain.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Define a production-ready system prompt that reflects the actual application domain, user expectations, and business requirements. Include specific instructions about tone, capabilities, limitations, and domain expertise. Key points: Tailor prompt to application's specific use case, include guardrails and behavior guidelines."

    "reasoning": "The models array contains only two hardcoded model configurations with no validation, dynamic loading, or configuration management. This static approach is not scalable or maintainable for production environments where model availability and configuration may change.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Implement a model configuration system using environment variables or a configuration service that can be updated without code changes. Use AISDKV5's model registry capabilities if available. Key points: Move model configurations to environment variables or a separate config file, add validation for model availability, implement fallback mechanisms."

    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Create comprehensive production-ready documentation including: application overview, features, installation instructions, environment variable configuration, deployment guide, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines.

    "fakeContentType": "placeholder",
    "reasoning": "The chat transport is configured to use '/api/weather' endpoint which contains mock weather tool implementations. This mismatch between endpoint naming and actual functionality indicates incomplete development where demo code hasn't been properly refactored.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Update to use a proper production chat endpoint. Either rename the weather route to accurately reflect its chat functionality, or create a new dedicated '/api/chat' endpoint without demo tools. Remove or properly implement the weather tool if it's a required feature. Key points: Align endpoint paths with functionality, remove demo tool implementations."

    "fakeContentType": "placeholder",
    "reasoning": "The generate_ui tool output uses a property named 'demo' to reference the V0 SDK's demoUrl. Using 'demo' as a property name in production code signals temporary or non-production implementation and creates confusion about whether the content is demonstration or production.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Rename the property from 'demo' to 'previewUrl' or 'componentUrl' to reflect production terminology. Update all references throughout the component rendering logic. Key points: Use production-appropriate naming conventions, ensure the V0 SDK integration is fully implemented with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms."

    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Implement proper attachment-only message handling that doesn't require placeholder text. Update the backend to properly process messages with only file attachments, or provide a more sophisticated UI flow for attachment-only submissions. Key points: Remove hardcoded placeholder strings, implement proper message type handling for attachments."

Production applications typically require image optimization settings, security headers, environment variable validation, and other critical configurations.",
    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Add production-ready Next.js configuration including: image domains whitelist for V0 assets, security headers, environment variable validation, build optimization settings, and API route configuration if needed. Key points: Configure image optimization for external sources, set up proper security headers, validate required environment variables at build time."

    "recommendedProductionSolution": "Evaluate whether Geist fonts align with the application's brand and design requirements. If they do, explicitly document this choice and remove the generic Next.js font setup pattern. If not, replace with brand-appropriate fonts loaded via next/font. Key points: Confirm font choices match production design requirements, ensure proper font licensing and loading optimization."
